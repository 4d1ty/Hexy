# Hexy

**Hexy** is a simple and lightweight hex dumper written in C++. It allows users to inspect binary files in a clear hex + ASCII format. Non-printable bytes are highlighted in red, and printable characters in green for easy reading.

Hexy is available as a **standalone tool** on GitHub, or bundled with **FoxBox**, an educational virtual machine for learning assembly with a custom instruction set called **Fennec Assembly**. Hexy is especially useful for exploring **Fennec Assembly bytecode** produced by FoxBox.

## Features

* Minimal and fast hex dumper for binary files.
* Prints **offsets**, **hex bytes**, and **ASCII representation**.
* Highlights printable and non-printable bytes using colors.
* Cross-platform: works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* Can be used standalone or bundled with **FoxBox** for inspecting Fennec Assembly bytecode.

---

## Build (Standalone)

You need a C++ compiler (C++20 recommended).

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -o hexy main.cpp
```

Or use the included Makefile:

```bash
make
```

* Produces `hexy` (Linux/macOS) or `hexy.exe` (Windows).

---

## Usage

```bash
./hexy <input_file>
```

Example:

```bash
./hexy example.bin
```

Output:

```
          00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f
00000000: 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21 0a 31 32 33 Hello World!.123
```

* **ASCII column:** printable characters are green, non-printable bytes appear as red `.`.
* Perfect for inspecting **Fennec Assembly bytecode** generated by FoxBox.

---

## Integration with FoxBox

Hexy comes bundled with **FoxBox** to make inspecting compiled Fennec Assembly binaries easy.

```bash
# Example workflow
foxbox assemble program.fa -o program.fb
hexy program.fb
```

* Shows the binary content of your Fennec Assembly programs in a human-readable format.
